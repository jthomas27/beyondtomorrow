## What Is This?

BeyondTomorrow is a self-running blog. AI agents handle the entire process — from finding topics to publishing finished articles. You provide the direction; the system does the rest.

**What it does:**

- 📝 **Writes blog posts automatically** — AI agents research, draft, edit, and publish
- 🔍 **Learns from your documents** — upload PDFs, emails, or web pages to inform the writing
- ⏱️ **Runs on a schedule** — new posts appear daily or weekly without manual effort
- 📧 **Accepts email commands** — send an email to trigger a post on a specific topic

---

## How It Works

The system follows a simple pipeline. Each step is handled by a dedicated AI agent.

### Step by Step

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Trigger** | A scheduled timer fires, or you send an email |
| **2. Research** | The AI searches the web and your uploaded documents for relevant info |
| **3. Summarise** | Key findings are condensed into notes |
| **4. Write** | A draft blog post is created |
| **5. Edit** | A separate AI agent reviews for quality, tone, and accuracy |
| **6. Publish** | The finished post goes live on the blog |
| **7. Notify** | You receive a success or failure alert |

### Knowledge Corpus

The AI doesn't just search the web — it also reads **your own documents** for context. This uses a technique called *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*:

1. You upload files (PDFs, emails, web pages) to storage
2. The system extracts and indexes the text
3. Before writing, agents search these documents for relevant information
4. Posts are more accurate because they draw on your source material

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| [Railway](https://railway.app) account | Hosts the blog and all services |
| [GitHub](https://github.com) account | Stores code and runs scheduled tasks |
| Domain name | Your blog's web address (e.g. beyondtomorrow.world) |
| GitHub PAT (models:read) | Powers all AI agents via [GitHub Models API](https://github.com/marketplace/models) |
| Hostinger email *(optional)* | Lets you trigger posts via email |

### Quick Start

**1. Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jthomas27/beyondtomorrow.git
cd beyondtomorrow
```

**2. Deploy to Railway**
- Log in to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
- Select this repository — Railway handles the rest

**3. Add services in Railway**

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| Ghost | The blog platform (displays your posts) |
| MySQL | Stores blog content |
| PostgreSQL | Stores document embeddings for AI search |
| Object Storage | Holds uploaded PDFs, images, and media |

**4. Set environment variables**

Add these in Railway's dashboard under **Variables**:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `GHOST_URL` | `https://beyondtomorrow.world` |
| `DATABASE_CLIENT` | `mysql` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Your GitHub PAT with `models:read` scope |

**5. Connect your domain**
- Go to Railway → **Settings** → **Domains**
- Add `beyondtomorrow.world`
- Update your DNS records at your registrar (instructions provided by Railway)
- SSL is set up automatically
